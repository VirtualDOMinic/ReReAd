Upcoming side project

## React Native notes
- See `/messing-around/HelloWorld` for react native demo app (WIP of course!)

### Setup on Linux

  * Didn't document these as I went along, but will try to retroactively!

### Setup on Windows
* TBC

### Setup on iOS (Android)
* TBC (Helen)

### Setup on iOS (iPhone)

## MVP
### Feature checklist / todos
Should this be a "user story" checklist?
- [ ] "Hello world" 
  - [x] On Android emulator (Linux)
  - [x] On iPhone emulator
  - [ ] On Android emulator (iOS)
- [ ] Home screen with app name and explanation
- [ ] Navigation bar
- [ ] "Home", "Reflect", "Remind", "Settings" (blank page?) buttons that go to a view
- [ ] Nice, basic layout, font, colours...
- [ ] TODO: Confirm questions/reflection stages
- [ ] TODO: decide data structure of reflection content
- [ ] Reflection process from start to finish
- [ ] Store reflection answers
- [ ] Display list of reflections in "remind"
- [ ] Allow going through specific reflections in "remind"
- [ ] Add ability to delete reflection

### Minor stretch goals
- [ ] "Hello world" on Windows
- [ ] Add your own sections to reflections (impacts data structure in feature checklist)
- [ ] Allow reflection edit

### Major stretch goals
- [ ] "Private"/initially hidden habits
- [ ] Sharing/publishing reflections for others to "remind" with (big goal!)
